Current Status: I believe the code is mostly correct, but there are some errors that I haven't hunted down yet.

General idea: Replace the color buffer with a texture coordinate buffer, and pull the color from there instead. Some key sections are:
	In function initBuffers()
		lines 257 - 302: Setting up the texture coordinate buffer
	Function handleLoadedTexture (texture)
		lines 356 - 364
	Function initTexture()
		lines 370 - 378
	In function drawScene()
		lines 403 - 410: Actually use the texture

	Altered the vertex and fragment shaders to use the texture colors
